    summary: |
      Installs the Aqua CLI using the universal installer script, sets in PATH, and upgrades.

      NOTE: The instructions for downloading the aqua-installer have a standard checksum verification step.
      This requires knowing the checksum for all versions, which we do not so we have decided to accept the risk and skip that step.

      Provide a version to install with the AQUA_INSTALLER_VERSION variable.
      example:
      > task aqua:install AQUA_INSTALLER_VERSION=v4.0.3

    silent: true
    vars:
      AQUA_INSTALLER_VERSION: v4.0.3
    cmds:
      - defer: rm ./aqua-installer
      - |
        touch ./aqua-installer
        curl -sSfL -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquaproj/aqua-installer/{{.AQUA_INSTALLER_VERSION}}/aqua-installer
        chmod +x aqua-installer
        ./aqua-installer

        printf "\n\n🌊 Aqua CLI has been installed, please add it to your PATH in ~/.bashrc or similar using the following command:"
        printf '\n\nexport PATH=\"${AQUA_ROOT_DIR:-${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/aquaproj-aqua}/bin:$PATH\"\n\n'
