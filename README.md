# Taskit

Taskit (said Task-kit or TK for short) is the Masterpoint [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) Kit. We utilize this set of Taskfiles across clients as a means by which to share repeatable tasks like repo setup, tool automation, and similar shared scripting.

## Using Taskit

Taskit is built around the idea of being consumed by downstream repos. It is pulled through our standard installation `Taskfile.yaml`

## TODO

- [ ] Create a test harness + tests around tasks
- [ ] Upstream various tasks from our distributed usage
- [ ] Publish versions
